# Sample authentication for Kikker project

Sample authentication project that will be used by other services

Have proof of concept:

* Deployment to Kubernetes
* Build locally with connection to Kubernetes (Telepresence?) to be able to use other service from the environment
* Make it work with JWT
* Bonus - Have stateful session handling (completely different architecture, keep on the different branch)
